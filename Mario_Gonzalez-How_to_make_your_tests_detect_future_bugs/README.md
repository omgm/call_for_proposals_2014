# They were sent from the future: how to make your tests detect future bugs.

Regression testing is invaluable to knowing if changes to code have broken the software. However, it always seems to be the case that no matter how many tests you have in your regression buckets, bugs continue to happily creep in undetected. As a result, you are not sure if you can trust your tests anymore or your methodology, and you are ready to change that. I will present a powerful technique called mutation testing that will help make your tests capable of detecting future bugs. I will also give you a metric to assess the effectiveness of your tests in terms of regression, so that future changes in your software can be done with impunity.


Audience will learn:
* What mutation testing is and why it works.
* When and how to apply mutation testing.
* How to improve their tests so they detect bugs that are introduced during the normal evolution of software.


## Mario Gonzalez Macedo

I started working on the unified theory of testing since college. At IBM, I got a chance to expand it and apply it, especially when working with customers for root-cause analysis in our enterprise storage products, as well as in development. Reachability graphs was one result of my work.

After IBM, I formed my own company called Ortask, where I now focus my attention developing tools that make testers more efficient, as well as researching/evangelizing testing techniques that have shown to yield high-quality results. Not surprisingly, I use both the theory and the tools quite often in my own testing.

I'm also currently writing a book that explains the unified theory of testing and all its useful details. the book will hopefully be available some time in 2014.
